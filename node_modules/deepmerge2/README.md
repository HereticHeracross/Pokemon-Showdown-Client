deepmerge2
=========

Merge the enumerable attributes of two objects deeply.

### What's the difference between deepmerge and deepmerge2?
Reason of creating this fork is inactivity of original deepmerge plugin.
This version has several bug fixes.

example
=======

```js
var util = require('util');
var merge = require('deepmerge2');

var x = {
  foo: { bar: 3 },
  array: [ { does: 'work', too: [ 1, 2, 3 ] } ]
};
var y = {
  quux: 5,
  foo: { baz: 4 },
  array: [ { does: 'work', too: [ 4, 5, 6 ] }, { really: 'yes' } ]
};

console.log(util.inspect(merge(x, y), false, null));
```

output:

```js
{
  quux: 5,
  foo: { bar: 3, baz: 4 },
  array: [ { does: 'work', too: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ] }, { really: 'yes' } ]
}
```

methods
=======

```js
var merge = require('deepmerge2');
```

merge(x, y)
-----------

Merge two objects `x` and `y` deeply, returning a new merged object with the
elements from both `x` and `y`.

If an element at the same key is present for both `x` and `y`, the value from
`y` will appear in the result.

The merge is immutable, so neither `x` nor `y` will be modified.

The merge will also merge arrays and array values.
